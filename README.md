### Hello  üëã
I'm Toluwase Babalola, a highly motivated AI and Data Science professional with a passion for leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems. Welcome to my portfolio!


üéì Education:
I hold a Masters of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from the University of Hull in England. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering at Kwara State University in Nigeria. My educational background has equipped me with a solid foundation in both technical engineering principles and advanced data science concepts.


üíª Skills:
My skillset spans a wide range of programming languages, including Python, SQL, Java, and C++. I am proficient in various libraries and frameworks such as NumPy, Sci-Py, Sci-Kit Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Additionally, I possess expertise in data mining, statistical analysis, business analysis, text and image classification, as well as data visualization and interpretation.


üöÄ Featured Projects:
Throughout my career, I have worked on several noteworthy projects that demonstrate my technical abilities and problem-solving skills. Here are some highlights:

- Malicious URL detection using Google's BERT and LSTM:
Trained and compared LSTM and Pre-trained BERT models to detect malicious webpages.
Achieved an impressive accuracy of 91.36% with the LSTM model, outperforming the Pre-trained BERT model due to hardware malfunctions.
Predicting Systolic Blood Pressure in Maternal Health:

- Designed and implemented a multiple linear regression model to predict systolic blood pressure in maternal health.
Incorporated factors such as age, blood sugar, and diastolic blood pressure to improve the accuracy of the model.
Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and enhance performance.
Detecting CO2 emission in motor vehicles:

- Implemented a kNeighbor classifier to train a model on a dataset of motor vehicle emissions data.
Conducted feature selection and engineering to optimize model performance.
Achieved a 4% improvement in fuel consumption, reducing CO2 emissions and increasing vehicle efficiency.
Customer Data Pre-Processing:

- Developed an algorithm to analyze customers' credit card validity, salary entries, distance commuted to work, and number of dependents.
Improved clients' financial operations by 6.5% by implementing data representation changes, filtering, and introducing a new metric for customer work status.
Emergency Vehicle Identification using deep learning:


üë®‚Äçüíº Related Experience:
I have gained valuable experience working in the industry, including the following roles:

Maintenance Analyst at ExecuJet Aviation:

Created an algorithm with spreadsheets to streamline procedure after-flight inspections, resulting in efficient reporting, documentation, and tracking of ground operations.
Developed methods to improve the interior and exterior surfaces of nosecones, significantly enhancing flight data recorder reusability.


üìö Certifications and Training:
I have continuously sought to expand my knowledge and skills through various certifications and training programs, including:

Internship: Cognizant Virtual Experience Program on Forage [May 2023].
Certifications: Data Scientist with Python Certification [DataCamp], Machine Learning Crash Course with TensorFlow APIs [Google Developers], Data Science Tools and Methodology [IBM Cognitive class], Machine Learning and Python [Data Science Nigeria].


üåê Memberships:
I am an active member of the Society of Artificial Intelligence, affiliated with the International Association of Engineers. I have also participated in the Internship Experience UK: Engineering Infrastructure program facilitated by Bright Network. Furthermore, I contribute to the Python Software Foundation, collaborating with other Python enthusiasts on open-source projects.
